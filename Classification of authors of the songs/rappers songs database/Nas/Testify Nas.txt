I just burnt my American flag
And sent three cracker Nazis to hell and I'm sad
Ugh, I'm loading tefs in my mag
To send these redneck bigots some death in a bag
Choke him out with his confederate flag
I know these devils are mad
Little rap fans who live way out in safe suburbia
Would you stand with me, a United States murdurer?

Don't buy my songs, y'all don't roll with it
Coming to concerts singing ho and shit
Fuck y'all lil' lil' ho bitches
I don't need y'all, I'll go gold with it
I heard y'all was downloading it (heh)
Like I'm y'all man who be exposing shit (heh)
Like uhh, William Cooper
Who told you the Pale Horse is the future
