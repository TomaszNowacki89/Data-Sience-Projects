This project focuses on natural language processing and building the predictive modelling to correctly classify the authors of lyrics (rappers) to the particular song. The database is a folder with songs, which were written by two rappers from New York - Jay Z and Nas. Each rapper has the repository of 50 songs, which will be divided to training and test set. Based on the training set, the knn algorithm will be used to predict the author of the song, using the term document matrix. The songs consists of only verses, without hooks and choruses to delete the collaborating atrists in the songs.
